# Capstone Project Module 2 ‚Äì Airbnb Bangkok Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes Airbnb listing performance in Bangkok using 2023 data. The goal was to find out how factors like pricing, room type, and listing activity affect guest interaction, and to provide practical recommendations that could help hosts improve their visibility and competitiveness.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy)
- Tableau Public
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Prices vary a lot depending on the neighborhood, and there are signs of seasonal patterns in availability.
- Listings priced between 1,000‚Äì1,500 THB generally performed better in terms of guest reviews.
- Hosts with fully active listings tend to get more recent reviews compared to those with inactive ones.

## Recommendations
1. Adjust pricing according to neighborhood and seasonal trends.
2. Use price tiers based on room type and listing category (e.g., private rooms as budget, entire homes as premium).
3. Keep listings active, update calendars regularly, and avoid long gaps in activity to maintain visibility and booking momentum.

## Statistical Validation
- Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA tests confirmed significant price differences between neighborhoods, room types, and categories.
- A t-test showed that hosts with all active listings receive significantly more reviews (p ‚âà 1.24 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∏‚Åµ).

2. Use tiered pricing aligned with room type and listing category  
3. Keep listings active to increase visibility and reviews
